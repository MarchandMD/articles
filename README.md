# Welcome to My Articles
I'm a hobbyist learning how to code/program/design  

One of the ways I learn is by writing things out, the long way. For me I've found it helps with my cognition and concept retention. YMMV (you're "mileage" may vary)  

As the articles grow, I'll do my best to update the list below.   

Currently:  

* [What is monkey patching?]()
* [Stubbing a method in RSpec]()
